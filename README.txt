*Directions*
Launch the application and log in with a valid username and password that matches information in the database.
From there you can view and manipulate data relating to customers and appointments.

*Additional Report*
For the custom report, the program is able to display appointments by country in the reports menu. I decided to 
use an SQL query that contains inner joins which combines three tables to return the list of appointments by country.
